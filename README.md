This repository includes the scripts and data of the proposed method. 

The scripts are in the R folder and include:

- benchdb.R - Script for batch runing on the datasets
- benchstepwise.R - Script for stepwise Cox model (forward)
- buildNet.R - Script for building dynamic gene co-express network
- dataForWanderlust.R - Script for preparing data for the Wanderlust method
- DownstreamAnalysis.R - Script for GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
- geneRank.R - Script for obtaining gene rank based on the integrative model
- getPseudotime.R - Script for getting the normalized pseudotime
- grid.search.R - Script for search parameters of the integrative model
- indepTest.R - Script for independent tests
- main.R - Main script for the proposed method
- survModels.R - Script for wraped survival model
- utils.R - Script for other support functions

The input data are in the data folder and include:
- EMTmarkers.rda - EMT gene markers
- README.txt - Deascription of data
- Benchmark.signatures.rda - The gene signatures of six benchmark methods
- pseudoTime.rda - VIM-time and EMT-time used in the paper
- seed.rda - The seeds used in the experiment to repreduce the results

The output data are in the output folder and include:
- Output R files of scPrognosis and benchmark methods
- Overlap of signatures for breast cancer prognosis
- The grid-search results of scPrognosis

Notes:

(1) The single-cell data GSE114397 is too big to upload here. You might need to download it from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE114397. Then ncRNA profiles need to be removed from this dataset. The selected mRNA short names are provided in the file data/GSE114397_mRNA.csv.

(2) GEO, TCGA753, UK can be downloaded from the link(https://github.com/XiaomeiLi1/Datasets/releases/tag/V1.0.1). The METABRIC data need to be download from the EMBL-EBI repository (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/, accession number EGAS00000000083, require individual access agreement).

(2) The source code of Wanderlust can be downloaded from http://www.c2b2.columbia.edu/danapeerlab/html/wanderlust.html.
